                <procdesc>Two sets of boundaries were collected and compared. The main set was obtained from David Duran, who collected boundaries from each region in the summer of 2001. The second set was obtained from Dean Tucker, who digitized boundaries for the Horizon Project. The main set from David Duran was determined to contain the most recent boundary information. Parks missing from David's set were added from Deans set. Those parks are..........Antietam NB Arlington House,Benjamin Franklin NMEM, Big Hole NB, Catoctin Mountain Park, Chesapeake and Ohio Canal NHP, Chimney Rock NHS, Fort Point NHS, Fredericksburg NC, George Washington Memorial Parkway, Green Springs, Harpers Ferry NHP, International Peace Garden, John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Kalaupapa NHP, Manassas NBP, Monocacy NB, National Capital Parks - Central and East, Olympic NP, Prince William Forest Park, Rock Creek Park, San Francisco Maritime NHP, Thaddeus Kosciuszko NMEM, and Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts. Park/Region staff were consulted for parks with major differences between the two sets.</procdesc>

Boundary data from LRD has separate polygons for individual types of units like Denali National Park and Denali National Preserve. Lands records in the dataset that can be identified by querying for [GIS_Notes] = "Lands" in the attribute table. LRD updated units are also identified in the place keywords of this metadata record but by alpha code and each units full name and desigination.</procdesc>
