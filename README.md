# 244 Final Project Shinyapp - AnimalDex

AnimalDex is developed by Benson Truong, Ruoyu Wang, and Shuhan Song. We are master students at Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In addition to our passion on environmental data science and a lot of love for wild animals, we are thriving to take off our careers as environmental professionals.
